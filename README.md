# Trending Hashtags Assignment

Approach - Utilized hashmap and treeset for storing the extracted hashtags.
Hashmap stores the key as hashtag strings and value as reference to hashtag objects in treeset

Time Complexity - O(logN) for adding new tweet. O(1) for getting top 10 hashtags

Update - Added the feature to load sample tweets from a data file along with 
manually adding new tweets.
